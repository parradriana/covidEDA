Eploratory Data Analysis of covid data from South Korea, supplied by KCDC (Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention).
You can find this dataset at Kaggle. Just two dtasets weere employed for the analysis (time and timeAge), I mostly use the package 
sidetable, fully integrate statistical analysis.  Easy to install with the command !pip install sidetable or !apt -get install

Integration (merge) and visualisation were made with libraries like pandas, numpy. Also, an SQlite table was built after integration 
and transformation of the data.
